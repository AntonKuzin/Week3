Recall that an inversion in an integer sequence A is a situation when i < j, but Ai > Aj.
 
Given a sequence of integers. Your task is to count the number of inversions in it.
 
Hint: to make it faster, you may adapt the mergesort algorithm to solve this problem.
Input
The ﬁrst line of the input ﬁle contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) – the number of elements in the sequence. The sequence itself follows in the second line. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed 109 by the absolute value.
Output
Output the number of inversions in the ﬁrst and only line of the output ﬁle.
